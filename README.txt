# Databases-and-the-web-assignement-1
This was a project I did for my first year of University, which I achieved 100% in. 
It was for my Databases and the Web module which covered SQL, HTML, CSS, JavaScript
Task 1 is a gym membership form.
Task 2 is a game where you put in a number and it creates that number of boxes with increasing distance between them. 
Task 3 is a tic tac toe game.
